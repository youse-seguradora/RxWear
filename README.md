This library wraps the Wearable API in [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/2.x) Observables and Singles. No more managing GoogleApiClients! Also, there are some helper classes, which ease communication between phone and wear app.

# Usage

Create an RxWear instance once, preferably in your Application's `onCreate()` or by using a dependency injection framework. The RxWear class is very similar to the Wearable class provided by the Wearable API. Instead of `Wearable.MessageApi.sendMessage(apiClient, nodeId, path, data)` you can use `rxWear.message().send(nodeId, path, data)`. 

There are also some helper methods to ease the putting/sending of data.
* `rxWear.data().putDataMap()`: Use this to put a DataItem containing a DataMap to a path or a pathPrefix with an auto appended ID. 
* `rxWear.data().putSerializable()`: Use this to put a DataItem containing a Serializable object to a path or a pathPrefix with an auto appended ID. 
* `rxWear.message().sendDataMap()`: Use this to send a message containing a DataMap to either one specific node or all remote nodes.
* `rxWear.message().sendSerializable()`: Use this to send a message containing a Serializable object to either one specific node or all remote nodes.

A few Observable Transformers are included to ease fetching the data. Since these include filtering, they cannot operate on Singles by default, but you can use `single.toObservable().compose(...)`.
* `DataEventGetDataMap`: Use this Transformer to get the DataMap from a DataEvent and optionally filter the events.
* `DataEventGetSerializable`: Use this Transformer to get a Serializable object from a DataEvent and optionally filter the events.
* `DataItemGetDataMap`: Use this Transformer to get the DataMap from a DataItem and optionally filter the items.
* `DataItemGetSerializable`: Use this Transformer to get a Serializable object from a DataItems and optionally filter the items.
* `MessageEventGetDataMap`: Use this Transformer to get the DataMap from a MessageEvent and optionally filter the events.
* `MessageEventGetSerializable`: Use this Transformer to get a Serializable object from a MessageEvent and optionally filter the events.

Example:

```java
RxWear rxWear = rxWear.init(context);

// Phone App

rxWear.message().sendDataMapToAllRemoteNodes("/dataMap")
	    .putString("title", "Title")
	    .putString("message", "My message")
	    .toObservable()
	    .subscribe(requestId -> {
	    	/* do something */
	    });

rxWear.data().putSerializable(serializable).urgent().to("/serializable")
        .subscribe(dataItem -> {
	        /* do something */
        });

// Wear App

rxWear.message().listen("/dataMap", MessageApi.FILTER_LITERAL)
        .compose(MessageEventGetDataMap.noFilter())
        .subscribe(dataMap -> {
            String title = dataMap.getString("title", getString(R.string.no_message));
            String message = dataMap.getString("message", getString(R.string.no_message_info));
            /* do something */
        });

rxWear.data().listen("/serializable", DataApi.FILTER_LITERAL)
        .compose(DataEventGetSerializable.<MySerializableType>filterByType(DataEvent.TYPE_CHANGED))
        .subscribe(serializable -> {
            /* do something */
        });

```

An optional global default timeout for all Wearable API requests made through the library can be set via `rxWear.setDefaultTimeout(...)`. In addition, timeouts can be set when creating a new Observable by providing timeout parameters, e.g. `rxWear.message().send(nodeId, path, data, 15, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`. These parameters override the default timeout. When a timeout occurs, a StatusException is provided via `onError()`. The timeouts specified here are only used for calls to the Wearable API, e.g. a timeout will not occur when a listener does not emit an item within the specified timeout. The RxJava timeout operators can be used for this use case.

You can also obtain a `Single<GoogleApiClient>`, which connects on subscribe and disconnects on unsubscribe via `GoogleAPIClientSingle.create(...)`.

The following Exceptions are thrown in the lib and provided via `onError()`:

* `StatusException`: When the call to the Wearable API was not successful or timed out
* `GoogleAPIConnectionException`: When connecting to the GoogleAPIClient was not successful.
* `GoogleAPIConnectionSuspendedException`: When the GoogleApiClient connection was suspended.

# Sample

A basic sample app is available in the `sample` and `wearsample` projects. 

# Setup

The lib is available on jCenter. Add the following to your `build.gradle`:

	dependencies {
	    compile 'com.patloew.rxwear:rxwear2:2.0.0'
	}
